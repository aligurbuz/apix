# Auto Package Development
* Apix utilizes the powerfull pool system.It presents most comfort for your application
* Packages pushing before on src/packages/auto can be used without loading by application developer
* For example; Csrf package that in src/packages/auto is loaded by system manager.
* This package is included automatically to the developed application
* It waits you to request on http:ip//company/service/project/packageName/index (default method : index)
